# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Heart Disease Prediction** project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on clinical and personal health data. The goal is to support early diagnosis and preventive healthcare using machine learning techniques.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest Pain Type
* Resting Blood Pressure
* Cholesterol
* Maximum Heart Rate
* ST Depression
* Target: Presence or Absence of Heart Disease

## ⚙️ Techniques Used

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, Encoding categorical data)
* Feature Scaling
* SMOTE for Handling Class Imbalance
* Model Building: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
* Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
* Model Evaluation: Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix

## 🚀 Results

The optimized model achieved strong predictive performance, accurately identifying patients with heart disease. Among all models, **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** yielded the best results.

## 📊 Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in assisting healthcare professionals to identify heart disease risk early, allowing for timely medical intervention.
